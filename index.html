		<dt>Yeet</dt>
		<dd>This meme originated around 2012, and became a hit. You usually exclaim it when 
		throwing something or a feeling of happiness</dd>
		
		<dt>Pepe the frog</dt>
		<dd>This meme originated form a cartoon an artist drew, and then skyrocketed to become
		one of the most popular memes of all time. It is a drawing of a very dejected looking 
		frog. Unfortunately, it died (lost popularity) a couple years ago</dd>
		
		<dt>Stonks Guy</dt>
		<dd>This meme emerged very recently. It is one of a very poorly 3-D modeled human
		with terribly bad grammar. It has become very popular, and you could say it has
		gained a lot of 'Stonks'</dd>
